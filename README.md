# KDDM-PROJECT.
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to discover spatial similarity between geographic locations using latitude and longitude data. The work follows the KDD pipeline and evaluates similarity through distance-based ranking and visual analysis rather than traditional prediction metrics.
